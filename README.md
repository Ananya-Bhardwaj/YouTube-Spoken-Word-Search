# Search-Words-in-Youtube

This project aims to make a chrome extension for YouTube videos. The extension will allow the users to search for timstamps when a word was spoken in the video. It would not require the users to search from the transcript. This extension would only work for videos having English as language of audio. 

In future, this project would be expanded for languages like Hindi and Hinglish as well.
